# a5_parallel_pipeline

These files need to be placed in a directory which contains a subdirectory of fastq.gz files and a subfolder with the standard a5_pipeline files.

the process is to first create a json of all files, then load this into the second process where they are processed in paralell. this is to allow for the json to be edited before the processing step should it need to be.
